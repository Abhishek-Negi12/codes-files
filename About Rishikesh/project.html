            <P id="rishipara">Set against the backdrop of the Himalayas and with the pristine Ganga flowing through it,
                the ancient town of
                Rishikesh is one of the major tourist and pilgrimage hubs in northern India, where people from across
                the
                world arrive in search of peace. Rishikesh is commonly referred to as the ‘yoga capital of the world’
                and
                rightly so. The destination is abuzz with visitors, who come here to learn yoga and meditation.
                Rishikesh
                has numerous ashrams, some of which are internationally recognised as centres of philosophical studies,
                yoga
                and other ancient Indian traditions of wellness. The Uttarakhand Tourism Development Board organises the
                annual International Yog Festival (IYF) here, which attracts thousands of yoga enthusiasts. There are
                several legends associated with Rishikesh. It is said Rishikesh finds a mention in the ancient text
                Skanda
                Purana, and in the epic Ramayana. It is said Lord Rama, along with his brothers, came to Rishikesh to do
                penance after killing Ravana.

                Rishikesh is also known for its connection with The Beatles. In February 1968, members of the legendary
                English rock band visited Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram (now popularly known as the Beatles Ashram) to
                learn transcendental meditation. The band composed nearly 48 songs during their time at the Maharishi's
                ashram, many of which appear on the White Album (and a few from Abbey Road). John Lennon recorded a song
                titled, 'The Happy Rishikesh Song' after his visit. Several other international artists,</P>

            <P id="gangapara">The Ganga Aarti is an ancient Hindu ritual, practised for centuries as a way to express
                reverence for the mighty Ganges River. Considered the embodiment of purity and the lifeblood of India,
                the Ganges holds immense significance for Hindus. The aarti, a form of worship with lamps, is a way to
                show gratitude to the river and seek its blessings.As dusk approaches, head towards one of the main
                ghats (bathing steps) in Rishikesh, like Triveni Ghat or Parmarth Niketan. You'll find a sea of people
                lining the ghats, all eager to witness the aarti. The ceremony begins with the chanting of mantras
                (sacred hymns) by priests adorned in saffron robes. They light numerous diyas (earthen lamps) filled
                with ghee (clarified butter) and arrange them on large trays.</P>
